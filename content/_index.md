Below is a collected list of low(ish) rank Verlinde categories. Click on the names for more information, including the fusion rules, Frobenius-Perron dimensions of the simple objects, and modular data.
Please see the [conventions]({{< relref "_conventions.md" >}}) page for how to use the site.
The goal is to be a kind of landing page for quick references to these categories for researchers and anyone interested.

For questions and/or suggestions, please email abaxi [**AT**] tamu [**DOT**] edu or open a GitHub issue. Replace the bracketed terms with the obvious replacements.
